# Machine Learning Coursework
These four assignments are my submissions for my 3rd year course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at Imperial College London.
This course focussed on teaching the basic principles involved in Machine Learning as well as providing the opportunity for practical application.
Each of the four assignments focussed on a different Machine Learning principle and came with a variety of tasks.
As the report will show, the coursework assignment came with non-code based questions as well which just required mathematical explanations (as can be seen in the report).
Each assignment has its own folder, with all of the code and a pdf of the accompanying report explaining the theory and the results that have been produced by the code.

The code is written in a variety of languages:
* Assignment 1: R
* Assignment 2: C++ (with use of Eigen)
* Assignment 3: Python
* Assignment 4: Python
